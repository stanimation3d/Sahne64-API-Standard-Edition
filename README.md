# Sahne64-API
Sahne64 is the standard kernel-user space communication API of Sahne Karnal architecture developed by Sahne Dünya. What is Sahne Karnal? Sahne Karnal is an independent operating system project developed by Sahne Dünya, you can read more information from the README file in the Sahne Karnal repository. Sahne64 is a standard API developed for this operating system. Some of you will not question, but why is this project separate from Sahne Karnal kernel? The reason for this is Karnal64 API, this API is considered as kernel services transfer API. This API can be used directly in kernel space. The purpose of this API is to combine the files in the kernel space in a single place and transmit them to the user space and kernel communication API, while the user space and kernel communication API transmits them to user space components. At the same time, Karnal64 is independent of the file, on the contrary, the files depend on it. Karnal64 communication with the user space and kernel communication API is not limited to Sahne64 and is even independent of Sahne64, Sahne64 depends on it. There may be thousands of kernels and user space communication APIs that support Karnel64 API, Sahne64 is just one of them. However, Sahne64 is the most popular API developed by Sahne Dünya, so the component built on Sahne Karnal that comes to mind is compatible with Sahne64.
